# Sorting_algorithems
Basically a pre-defined function known as 'sort' is present in PYTHON to sort the element's that are given in the array.

A program is considered as the most effecient program if and only if the time complexity and the space complexity is less. Hence in some cases we use the sorting code insted of
sort function if we are encountered to time complexity.

some of the sorting code's(techniques) are: bubble sort, Insertion sort, selection sort, Merg sort, and Quick sort.
